  - SENDGRID_API_KEY not set up
  - Video/SMS functionality cannot work without these
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Missing tables/columns for full functionality
  - Consultation sessions table may be incomplete
  - Missing indexes for performance
  - RLS policies may be blocking queries
- [ ] **Development Data**: No seed data for testing
  - Need sample consultants with availability
  - Need sample students with sessions
  - Need complete user scenarios for testing

## üéØ **REALISTIC COMPLETION ESTIMATE**

### **Current State**: ~30% Complete (UI Only)
### **To Functional MVP**: ~40-60 hours of development needed

**Week 1 (16-20 hours)**: Core API Implementation
- [ ] Fix session booking API and database queries
- [ ] Implement Twilio Video endpoints and integration
- [ ] Create database seed data for testing
- [ ] Fix notification system database queries

**Week 2 (16-20 hours)**: Feature Completion  
- [ ] Complete consultant availability system
- [ ] Implement hour tracking and progress APIs
- [ ] Set up SendGrid email integration
- [ ] Implement file upload system

**Week 3 (8-12 hours)**: Integration & Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of complete user flows
- [ ] Fix remaining API failures and edge cases
- [ ] Implement admin management features
- [ ] Production deployment preparation

## üö® **CRITICAL INSIGHTS**

### **Why Platform Appears "Working" But Isn't**:
1. **Frontend UI is polished** - Makes it seem complete
2. **Authentication works** - Users can log in and navigate  
3. **Static content loads** - Dashboards show layout
4. **Real functionality is missing** - APIs fail when users try to DO anything

### **Core Development Priorities**:
1. **Fix session booking** - This is the heart of the platform
2. **Integrate Twilio properly** - Video is critical for EMDR sessions
3. **Create seed data** - Cannot test without consultants/sessions
4. **End-to-end user flows** - Test actual business processes

### **Risk Assessment**:
- **HIGH RISK**: Platform cannot be demonstrated to client as-is
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Additional 1-2 weeks needed to reach functional state  
- **LOW RISK**: Core architecture is sound, issues are implementation-level

## üìã **NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

1. **Fix session booking API** (Day 1)
2. **Create development seed data** (Day 1)  
3. **Implement Twilio video endpoints** (Day 2-3)
4. **Fix notification system** (Day 2)
5. **Test complete user flow** (Day 3-4)

**UPDATED**: January 2025 - After comprehensive API testing
**STATUS**: Core functionality broken despite polished UI
**ETA TO WORKING MVP**: 2-3 weeks with focused development
