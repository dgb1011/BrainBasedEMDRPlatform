# 🚀 BrainBased EMDR Platform - Development Handoff

## START HERE: Immediate Action Plan

**Current Status**: 70% Complete - Ready for final sprint to production  
**Critical Issues**: 3 major blockers preventing launch  
**Time to Launch**: 4-5 weeks with focused effort

---

## 🔥 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Fix First)

### 1. Video Infrastructure Failure
**Issue**: WebSocket errors preventing video sessions  
**Impact**: Core functionality broken  
**Fix Required**: 8-12 hours

```bash
# Current Error:
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:undefined' failed

# Action Required:
1. Edit client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts (already partially fixed)
2. Set up production TURN/STUN servers
3. Test video sessions end-to-end
```

### 2. Consultant Availability System
**Issue**: Availability save/load not working properly  
**Impact**: Consultants can't manage schedules  
**Fix Required**: 4-6 hours

```bash
# Current Issue:
- Availability API returns 404 errors
- Frontend shows loading states but no data
- Backend routes exist but may have auth/data issues

# Action Required:
1. Debug /api/consultants/availability endpoints
2. Test availability calendar UI end-to-end
3. Verify database queries and data structure
```

### 3. Notification System Errors
**Issue**: Console spam from notification API failures  
**Impact**: User experience degradation  
**Fix Required**: 2-4 hours

```bash
# Current Error:
500 (Internal Server Error) on /api/notifications/count

# Action Required:
1. Fix notification endpoints in server/routes.ts
2. Handle empty notification states gracefully
3. Test notification delivery workflow
```

## 🛠️ QUICK START DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

### 1. Environment Setup (15 minutes)
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone [repository]
cd BrainBasedEMDRPlatform
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# Key environment variables to configure:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
TURN_SERVER_URL=your_turn_server
TURN_USERNAME=your_turn_username  
TURN_CREDENTIAL=your_turn_password
```

### 2. Start Development Server (2 minutes)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Access application
# Open http://localhost:5000

# Test login credentials:
# Admin: admin@brainbasedemdr.com / password123
# Student: student@test.com / password123  
# Consultant: consultant@test.com / password123
```

### 3. Verify Current Status (10 minutes)
```bash
# Check these core workflows:
□ Login works for all user types
□ Admin dashboard loads without errors
□ Student can see progress tracking
□ Consultant can access availability (currently broken)
□ Video session page loads (may have WebSocket errors)
□ Certificate generation works
```

## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES - Step by Step

### Fix 1: WebSocket Connection (Priority 1)
```javascript
// File: client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts
// Current Issue: URL construction failing

// Quick Fix:
const connect = () => {
  if (!url) {
    const protocol = window.location.protocol === "https:" ? "wss:" : "ws:";
    let host = window.location.host;
    
    // Fallback for development - THIS NEEDS FIXING
    if (!host || host === 'localhost' || !host.includes(':')) {
      host = 'localhost:5000';
    }
    
    url = `${protocol}//${host}/ws`;
  }
  // ... rest of connection logic
};
```

### Fix 2: Availability API (Priority 2)
```bash
# Debug steps:
1. Test API endpoint manually:
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" http://localhost:5000/api/consultants/availability

2. Check server logs for errors
3. Verify consultant profile exists in database
4. Test with seeded consultant user
```

### Fix 3: Notifications API (Priority 3)
```javascript
// File: server/routes.ts  
// Current Issue: Notification endpoints returning 500

// Quick Fix - add error handling:
app.get('/api/notifications/count', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const userId = (req as any).user.userId;
    
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('notifications')
      .select('id')
      .eq('user_id', userId)
      .eq('read', false);

    if (error) throw error;
    
    res.json({ count: data?.length || 0 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Notification count error:', error);
    res.json({ count: 0 }); // Graceful fallback
  }
});
```

## 📊 TESTING STRATEGY

### Immediate Testing (After fixes)
```bash
# Test video sessions
1. Login as student
2. Go to /video/test-session-id  
3. Verify WebSocket connects
4. Test camera/microphone access

# Test consultant availability
1. Login as consultant
2. Go to /availability
3. Try to save weekly schedule
4. Verify data persists and loads

# Test notifications
1. Login as any user
2. Check notification bell icon
3. Verify no console errors
4. Test notification dropdown
```

### Production Readiness Testing
```bash
# Load Testing
- 10+ concurrent video sessions
- 100+ simultaneous users
- Certificate generation under load

# Security Testing  
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attack vectors
- Authentication bypass attempts

# Browser Testing
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile iOS/Android browsers
- Video session compatibility
```

## 🚨 COMMON GOTCHAS & SOLUTIONS

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Symptom: 500 errors on all API calls
# Solution: Check .env file has correct Supabase credentials
# Test: curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### Build Failures
```bash
# Symptom: TypeScript compilation errors
# Solution: Check for .js/.ts duplicate files in server/
# Clean: Remove .js files, keep only .ts versions
```

### Authentication Problems
```bash
# Symptom: Always redirected to login
# Solution: Check JWT_SECRET in .env matches
# Test: Login and check browser dev tools for auth cookie
```
