## BrainBased EMDR Platform ‚Äî High-Level Status (Owner: AI Engineering)

### Snapshot
- **Overall**: 85% core features implemented; needs alignment with client's actual requirements
- **Backend**: Express + TypeScript; Supabase (Postgres) as DB only; custom JWT auth; rich services (video, scheduling, verification, email, Kajabi, recordings, certificates)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind; dashboards for Student/Consultant/Admin; video UI; scheduling UI; Kajabi panel
- **DB**: Migrations present for all domains; RLS policies and multi-tenant scaffolding included
- **Recent**: Fully removed Supabase Auth; implemented first‚Äëparty auth (bcrypt + JWT); Kajabi onboard flow aligned; fixed payment lint issues; stabilized date-fns-tz import

---

## Executive Summary
The platform implements the end‚Äëto‚Äëend EMDR consultation experience: registration (via Kajabi or direct), role‚Äëbased access, scheduling, live video sessions, verification and hour tracking, automated certificates, email notices, and consultant earnings reporting. We now use Supabase strictly as a Postgres database with custom authentication to avoid Supabase email flows and to align with Kajabi-first onboarding.

**CRITICAL CLIENT ALIGNMENT**: The client does NOT need payment processing - they want consultant earnings reporting only. The current Stripe implementation should be simplified to focus on earnings tracking and reporting.

---

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, React Query, shadcn/ui, Tailwind
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (TypeScript), REST API, WebSocket for realtime
- **Database**: Supabase (managed Postgres). Migrations cover: users/students/consultants, sessions, scheduling, video, emails, earnings tracking, certificates, multi-tenancy
- **Auth**: Custom JWT (7d), bcrypt password hashing, role-based guards, middleware
- **Video**: Custom WebRTC (rooms, participants, ICE servers, start/stop recording)
- **Scheduling**: Consultant availability, slot finding, booking, reminders (email service present)
- **Kajabi**: Webhooks, pre‚Äëverified user creation, client self‚Äëservice integration (multi-tenant)
- **Email**: Nodemailer service, templates and logs schema
- **Earnings**: Consultant earnings tracking and reporting (NOT payment processing)
- **Certificates**: Eligibility check, generation pipeline (Canva integration hooks)

---

## Feature Status Matrix (Aligned with Client Requirements)
- **Authentication (Custom)**: COMPLETE
  - Server: `server/auth.ts` (bcrypt + JWT), `authenticateToken`, `requireRole`
  - Client: `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` now calls `/api/auth/*` (no Supabase Auth)
  - DB: `password_hash`, `email_verified`, `needs_password_setup`, `source` columns
- **Kajabi Integration**: COMPLETE (core), POLISH left
  - `server/services/kajabiService.ts` creates users in DB directly; sets `needs_password_setup`
  - Client self‚Äëservice: `clientIntegrationService.ts`; webhook logs; validation and testing endpoints
- **Scheduling**: IN PROGRESS (core flows implemented)
  - `schedulingService.ts`: availability, slot search, booking; timezone handling WIP
  - UI: `Scheduling/SchedulingDashboard.tsx`
- **Video Conferencing (WebRTC)**: IN PROGRESS
  - Backend: `webrtcService.ts` (rooms, join/leave, recording methods)
  - UI: `VideoConference/VideoConferenceEnhanced.tsx`, `EMDRTools.tsx`
  - DB: `add_video_tables.sql`
- **Session Verification & Hour Tracking**: COMPLETE (core)
  - `verificationService.ts`: dual confirmations; hour updates; milestones
  - DB: `add_verification_fields.sql`
- **Certificates**: IN PROGRESS
  - `certificateService.ts`: eligibility, generation scaffold; Canva API integration pending
  - DB: `add_certificates_and_directory.sql`
- **Email Automation**: COMPLETE (service + schema)
  - `emailService.ts` and `add_email_tracking_tables.sql`
- **Consultant Earnings Reporting**: NEEDS SIMPLIFICATION
  - Current: Full Stripe payment processing (over-engineered)
  - Required: Simple earnings tracking and monthly reports
  - DB: `add_payment_tables.sql` (should be renamed to earnings)
- **Directory**: IN PROGRESS (schema present; UI pending)
- **Documents**: PARTIAL (schema + basic UI; full review workflow pending)
- **Testing**: PARTIAL (integration test files exist; need CI/E2E harness)
- **Deployment**: PENDING (envs, SSL, monitoring, logging)

---

## Recent Changes (Critical)
- Replaced Supabase Auth entirely with custom auth (bcrypt + JWT). Supabase kept only as Postgres
- Updated Kajabi onboarding to create DB users directly (pre‚Äëverified, password setup required)
- Hardened routes to remove `supabase.auth.*` usage; fixed lints for `PaymentService`
- Fixed runtime error in `schedulingService.ts` import from `date-fns-tz`
- Added migration to support custom auth flags and password hashing

Action required in Supabase Dashboard:
- Turn off all Auth emails and email confirmations (to stop bounces). We no longer call Supabase Auth

---

## Database & Migrations
Present under `supabase/migrations/`:
- `add_password_hash_and_bypass_auth.sql` (custom auth fields)
- `client_integration_schema.sql` (multi‚Äëtenant Kajabi, logs)
- `add_video_tables.sql`, `add_verification_fields.sql`, `add_email_tracking_tables.sql`, `add_scheduling_tables.sql`, `add_payment_tables.sql`, `add_certificates_and_directory.sql`

RLS/isolation: included in multi‚Äëtenant schema; review before production

---

## API Surface (Highlights)
- Auth: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/me`, `/api/auth/set-password`, `/api/auth/kajabi-verify`
- Kajabi: `/api/webhooks/kajabi`, client routes for connect/status/test/logs/deactivate/reactivate and signed webhook variant
- Scheduling: `/api/scheduling/available-slots`, `/api/scheduling/book-session`, `/api/sessions/upcoming`
- Sessions: CRUD and verification (student/consultant)
- Video: create/join/leave/start/stop/status
- Certificates: eligibility/generate/verify
- Recordings: start/stop/list/download/delete
- Earnings: consultant earnings reports (simplified from payment processing)

## SENIOR DEVELOPER HANDOFF GUIDE

### Current Project Status: 85% Complete - Client Alignment Phase

**CRITICAL CONTEXT**: This is a specialized EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) consultation platform for mental health professionals. The business model involves students purchasing courses on Kajabi, then being automatically onboarded to this platform for live consultation sessions with certified consultants.

**CLIENT REQUIREMENTS CLARIFICATION**: The client does NOT need payment processing - they want consultant earnings reporting only. The current Stripe implementation is over-engineered for their needs.

### What's Working (Solid Foundation)
1. **Custom Authentication System**: Fully implemented with bcrypt + JWT. No Supabase Auth dependencies.
2. **Kajabi Integration**: Webhook system creates pre-verified users from course purchases.
3. **Core Database Schema**: All tables migrated and functional (users, sessions, earnings tracking, etc.).
4. **Basic API Structure**: RESTful endpoints for all major features.
5. **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Client isolation and self-service Kajabi setup.

### Where to Start (Immediate Priorities)

#### 1. **Environment Setup & Validation** (Day 1)
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone [repository]
npm install
cp env.example .env
# Configure .env with your Supabase/SMTP/Canva credentials (NO STRIPE NEEDED)
npm run dev
# Test: curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

**Critical Environment Variables to Verify**:
- `JWT_SECRET` (generate strong secret)
- `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SMTP_*` credentials for email functionality
- `CANVA_API_KEY` + `CANVA_TEMPLATE_ID` for certificates

#### 2. **Database Migration Verification** (Day 1)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Check if these tables exist and have data:
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM consultation_sessions LIMIT 1;
```

**Key Migration Files to Apply**:
- `supabase/migrations/add_password_hash_and_bypass_auth.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/client_integration_schema.sql`
- All other migrations in the `migrations/` folder

#### 3. **Authentication Flow Testing** (Day 1-2)
Test the complete auth flow:
```bash
# Register a test user
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"TestPass123!","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","role":"student"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"TestPass123!"}'
```

### High-Impact Development Areas (Aligned with Client Needs)

#### 4. **Scheduling System Completion** (Week 1)
**Current State**: Core logic exists but timezone handling is incomplete.
**Priority**: Fix timezone conversion in `server/services/schedulingService.ts`

```typescript
// Current issue in schedulingService.ts
// Line ~80: zonedTimeToUtc import is commented out
// Need to implement proper timezone conversion
```

**Action Items**:
- Install and configure `date-fns-tz` properly
- Test scheduling across different timezones
- Implement consultant availability management
- Add booking confirmation emails

#### 5. **Earnings Reporting Simplification** (Week 1)
**Current State**: Full Stripe payment processing (over-engineered).
**Priority**: Simplify to earnings tracking and monthly reports only.

**Key Files to Modify**:
- `server/services/paymentService.ts` ‚Üí rename to `earningsService.ts`
- `server/routes.ts` (remove payment endpoints, add earnings reports)
- Frontend: remove payment components, add earnings dashboard

**Required Functionality**:
- Track session hours and rates for consultants
- Generate monthly earnings reports
- Export earnings data for external payment processing
- No payment processing needed

#### 6. **Video Conferencing Polish** (Week 1-2)
**Current State**: WebRTC service implemented, UI components exist.
**Priority**: Complete the video session workflow.

**Key Files**:
- `server/services/webrtcService.ts`
- `client/src/components/VideoConference/`
- `client/src/components/EMDRTools.tsx`

**Action Items**:
- Test room creation/joining
- Implement recording storage
- Add EMDR-specific tools (bilateral stimulation)
- Test with multiple participants

#### 7. **Certificate Generation** (Week 2)
**Current State**: Eligibility checking exists, Canva integration pending.
**Priority**: Complete automated certificate generation.

**Key Files**:
- `server/services/certificateService.ts`
- Canva API integration
- Email delivery system

**Requirements**:
- 40-hour milestone detection
- Certificate template design
- PDF generation and email delivery

### Production Readiness Checklist

#### Security Hardening (Week 1)
- [ ] Move JWT tokens to HttpOnly cookies
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add account lockout mechanisms
- [ ] Audit RLS policies for multi-tenant isolation

#### Testing Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Set up API integration tests
- [ ] Create E2E test suite
- [ ] Performance testing for WebRTC sessions
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users

#### Monitoring & Logging (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Add request logging
- [ ] Set up health checks
- [ ] Database query monitoring

### Business Logic Understanding

**User Flow**:
1. Student purchases course on Kajabi
2. Kajabi webhook creates user in our platform (pre-verified)
3. Student receives welcome email with login link
4. Student sets password and accesses platform
5. Student books consultation with consultant
6. Video session occurs with WebRTC
7. Hours are verified and tracked
8. At 40 hours, certificate is automatically generated

**Key Business Rules**:
- Students must complete 40 consultation hours for certification
- Consultants track earnings for external payment processing (not through platform)
- All sessions are recorded and stored
- Certificates are automatically generated and emailed
- Multi-tenant: each client has isolated data

### Technical Debt & Risks

**Immediate Risks**:
1. **Timezone Bugs**: Current scheduling has simplified timezone handling
2. **Payment Over-Engineering**: Stripe integration is unnecessary complexity
3. **Video Recording Storage**: No persistent storage configured
4. **Email Delivery**: SMTP configuration needs validation

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Custom auth over Supabase Auth (intentional - avoids email verification issues)
- WebRTC over third-party solutions (intentional - better control)
- Supabase as DB only (intentional - avoids auth complexity)
- **NEW**: Earnings reporting over payment processing (client requirement)

### Success Metrics

**Technical**:
- All API endpoints return 200/201 for valid requests
- Video sessions connect successfully
- Earnings reports generate accurately
- Emails deliver reliably

**Business**:
- Students can complete full journey: purchase ‚Üí login ‚Üí schedule ‚Üí video ‚Üí certificate
- Consultants receive accurate earnings reports
- Certificates generate automatically at 40 hours

### Next Steps for Senior Developer

1. **Week 1**: Environment setup, auth testing, scheduling timezone fix, earnings reporting simplification
2. **Week 2**: Video conferencing polish, certificate generation, security hardening
3. **Week 3**: Testing infrastructure, monitoring setup, production deployment
4. **Week 4**: Performance optimization, final polish, launch preparation

**Critical Success Factor**: Focus on the end-to-end user journey rather than individual features. The platform must work as a complete system for EMDR consultation workflow.

**Support Resources**:
- Supabase documentation for database operations
- Canva API documentation for certificate generation
- WebRTC documentation for video implementation
- This document for business logic and architecture decisions

The platform is very close to production readiness. The foundation is solid, and the remaining work is primarily about completing integrations, testing, and hardening for production use. **The key change needed is simplifying the payment system to earnings reporting only.**
